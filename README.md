## Aim :

Three phase power measurement by two wattmeter method.

## Procedure
BALANCED LOAD :

1. Set the 3Phase (Line to Line) voltage 100 V at frequency = 50Hz.
2. Set the balanced load value.

3. Switch on the supply to get the meter readings and click on "Fill the Table" button to update the observation table.

4. Compare calculated power (WC) with the measured power (WM) for each observation.

5. Then change the balanced load value to take another observation.
N.B.: Click on the fuse indicator to repair it, if it got fused.

UNBALANCED LOAD :

 ## Procedure:
1. Set the 3Phase (Line to Line) voltage to 100 V at frequency =50Hz.
2. Set different values for R1, R2 and R3.
3. Switch on the supply to get the meter readings and click on "Fill the Table" button to update the observation table.
4. Compare calculated power (WC) with the measured power (WM) for each observation.
5. Change the values of R1, R2 and R3 to take another observation.
N.B.: Click on the fuse indicator to repair it, if it got fused.

## Result:  
Thus Three phase power measurement by two wattmeter method is Verfied.
